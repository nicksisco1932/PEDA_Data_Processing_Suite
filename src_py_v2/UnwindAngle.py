UnwindAngle.py

Python stub for the MATLAB function UnwindAngle.m.

Role:
    - Utility for unwrapping/normalizing angles (e.g., beam angles) into a
      continuous or canonical range.

Note:
    In the MATLAB pipeline, UnwindAngle was allowed to be shadowed. Here, we
    provide a dedicated stub to satisfy Python task_master checks.

Implementation TBD.
